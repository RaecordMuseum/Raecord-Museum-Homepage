<p>The Ankh-Morpork City Watch is the police force of the fictional city of Ankh-Morpork
  in the Discworld series by the English writer Terry Pratchett.

The Watch, its growth and development, and its inner workings are explored through a series of
 eight fantasy novels and one short story. These novels generally feature as the protagonist,
 the Watch Commander Sam Vimes, and take on the general shape of a crime novel, in which the Watch

 (1989), "Theatre of Cruelty" (1993) (a short story), Men at Arms (1993), Feet of Clay (1996),

 Besides these main stories, the Watch, and individual members thereof, appear in some form in
 many of the other Discworld novels, especially those set in Ankh-Morpork.</p>
