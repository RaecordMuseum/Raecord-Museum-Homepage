<h2>Movement of 21st centry "Art"</h2>
<p>A <strong>virtual museum</strong> is a digital entity that draws on the characteristics of a museum, 
  in order to complement, enhance, or augment the museum experience through personalization,
  interactivity and richness of content. Virtual museums can perform as the digital footprint
   of a physical museum, or can act independently, while maintaining the authoritative status
   as bestowed by the International Council of Museums (ICOM) in its definition of a museum.
   In tandem with the ICOM mission of a physical museum, the virtual museum is also committed to
   public access; to both the knowledge systems imbedded in the collections and the systematic,
   and coherent organization of their display, as well as to their long-term preservation.</p>
