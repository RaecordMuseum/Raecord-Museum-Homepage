<h2>EXHIBITIONS & EVENTS</h2>
<p>An exhibition, in the most general sense, is an organized presentation and display of a selection
   of items. In practice, exhibitions usually occur within a cultural or educational setting
   such as a museum, art gallery, park, library, exhibition hall, or World's fairs. Exhibitions
   can include many things such as art in both major museums and smaller galleries, interpretive
   exhibitions, natural history museums and history museums, and also varieties such as more
   commercially focused exhibitions and trade fairs.</p>
